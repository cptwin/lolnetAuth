![lolnetAuthLogo](http://auth.lolnet.co.nz/images/lolnetAuthlogo.png)

lolnetAuth is a really easy to use security plugin for your server! Players are required to register upon first joining your server and then every time they join the server they are required to log in before they can do anything.

This plugin was developed because of the complexity of other Auth plugins so lolnetAuth was developed from the ground up to be simple but secure! You can see a currently working version on our server!

Commands:

/login yourpassword

/register yourpassword youremail

/recover

/changepassword yourpassword yourpasswordagain
